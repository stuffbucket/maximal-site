// The update manifest the desktop app polls to learn the latest version.
// Prerendered to dist/updates/manifest.json at build time and served (static,
// CDN-cached, no auth, no rate limit) at:
//   https://stuffbucket.github.io/maximal-site/updates/manifest.json
// Clients can poll it directly with no redirect or API rate limit.
//
// FALLBACK, not the primary writer (issue #220, phase 1). The release workflow
// writes public/updates/manifest.json at publish time via
// scripts/write-updates-manifest.ts — fed the release's OWN tag + assets, so it
// names its own tag and is fresh-on-publish (no `releases/latest` propagation
// lag). Astro serves public/** verbatim and SKIPS this route when that
// file exists (a public file wins a same-path collision), so once a release has
// committed the manifest, the release-authored copy is what ships. This route
// still generates the manifest when the public file is absent (first-ever
// build / migration), so the site always has a manifest. Both mechanisms reuse
// the SAME pure buildManifest below — one source of truth for the schema.
//
// Shape — channel-keyed and schema-versioned so adding a `nightly` channel
// later is a server-only, non-breaking change. `beta` is omitted when no
// prerelease exists. Schema 2 adds a per-channel `tag` and a keyed `downloads`
// map; see src/lib/updates-manifest.ts for the full contract. The bump is
// additive — schema-1 desktop clients keep reading `channels.stable.version`
// byte-for-byte unchanged.
//
// SECURITY: the `downloads` map is BROWSER-ONLY. The desktop client
// (src/lib/update-check.ts) must read ONLY `version` and keep DOWNLOAD_URL a
// compile-time constant, so a tampered manifest can at most misreport a
// version — never redirect a download. Do NOT wire the installer to
// downloads.url. `notes` is a display-only link to the GitHub release.
//
// FALLBACK-ONLY as of #223: the primary manifest is the committed
// public/updates/manifest.json (Astro serves public/** verbatim and a
// public file wins a same-path collision, so this route is skipped when that
// file exists — which it always does in the repo). This route now re-emits from
// that SAME committed manifest (resolveLatestRelease reads it), so if the public
// file were ever removed the route regenerates a byte-equivalent document. No
// GitHub API, no GITHUB_TOKEN, no SITE_PIN. An absent channel emits empty
// channels, so the desktop client reads "unknown" / no update.
